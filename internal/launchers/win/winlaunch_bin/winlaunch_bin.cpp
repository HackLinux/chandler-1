     * SetDllDirectory is an entry point defined in XP SP1 that allows
     * us to specify a directory to search first. Check to see if we
     * can use it and give it a tryGoogle says:
     *
     * "No longer is the current directory searched first when loading DLLs!
     * This change was also made in Windows XP SP1. The default behavior now
     * is to look in all the system locations first, then the current directory,
     * and finally any user-defined paths. This will have an impact on your code
     * if you install a DLL in the application's directory because Windows Server
     * 2003 no longer loads the 'local' DLL if a DLL of the same name is in the
     * system directory. A common example is if an application won't run with a
     * specific version of a DLL, an older version is installed that does work
     * in the application directory. This scenario will fail in Windows Server 2003.
     * 
     * The reason this change was made was to mitigate some kinds of trojaning
     * attacks. An attacker may be able to sneak a bad DLL into your application
     * directory or a directory that has files associated with your application.
     * The DLL search order change removes this attack vector.
     *
     * The SetDllDirectory function, also available in Windows XP SP1, modifies
     * the search path used to locate DLLs for the application and affects all
     * subsequent calls to the LoadLibrary and LoadLibraryEx functions by the
     * application."
