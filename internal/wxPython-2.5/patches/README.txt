This directory contains patches that have been applied to this source
tree which have *not* been applied to the CVS tree.  Usually the
reason for this is that the change would break binary compatibility of
a stable branch, or it is something that fixes a problem that wxPython
users are experiencing that has not yet been agreed to by the rest of
the core wxWindows developers.
