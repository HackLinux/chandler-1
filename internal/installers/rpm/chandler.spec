# Remember to update the makeinstaller.sh script if you update
# the Version or Release info - it sadly requires that info
# so it can copy the generated .rpm file properly
# 
#
# This spec file is very lightweight as most of the work
# has already been done by the build process.
# The rpm -ba call is made *after* the source files
# are placed into the RPM_BUILD_ROOT directory (that's
# why you don't see an install section below or even
# a Source/Source0 entry)
