=======================
The Spike Content Model
=======================

.. contents:: **Table of Contents**


-------------------------------
Content Items and Action Stamps
-------------------------------

Spike's content model distinguishes between two major kinds of entities:
items, and stamps.  Items contain pure "content" (like text, a photo, or a web
page), while stamps contain tracking information used to manage actions
associated with items.  For example, a "Task" stamp is used to track a
completion status and due date associated with an item.

Most PIM objects will be either items or stamps, and will therefore derive
from either ``pim.content.Item`` or ``pim.content.Stamp``::

    >>> from pim.content import Item, Stamp


Content Items
=============

Content items have ``displayName``, ``importance``, and ``isPrivate``
attributes, all with default values::

    >>> item = Item()
    >>> item.displayName
    '<pim.content.Item object at ...>'
    >>> item.importance
    Importance.normal
    >>> item.isPrivate
    False

A content item's string form is its ``displayName``::

    >>> item.displayName = u"Foo"
    >>> print item, str(item), unicode(item)
    Foo Foo Foo

Content items also have a ``createdOn`` datetime that is initialized with the
current time as of the moment it's first accessed::

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> datetime.now() <= item.createdOn <= datetime.now()
    True

And content items' importance is an enumeration of possible values::

    >>> from pim.content import Importance
    >>> sorted(Importance)
    [Importance.fyi, Importance.important, Importance.normal]

Content items can have a ``body``::

    >>> item.body = "You're no-body till you have a body"
    >>> item.body
    "You're no-body till you have a body"

and a ``creator``, which must be a ``Contact``::

    >>> from pim.content import Contact
    >>> item.creator = Contact(emailAddress="foo@example.com")
    >>> print item.creator
    foo@example.com


Action Stamps
=============

A valid stamp is always associated with exactly one content item, and it takes
its display name from that item::

    >>> aStamp = Stamp(contentItem = item)
    >>> print aStamp.contentItem
    Foo
    >>> print aStamp
    Foo

Once set, a stamp's content item cannot be removed or changed, from either
end of the relationship::

    >>> del aStamp.contentItem
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: A stamp's content item cannot be changed

    >>> aStamp.contentItem = Item()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: A stamp's content item cannot be changed

    >>> item.actionStamps.remove(aStamp)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: A stamp's content item cannot be changed

Stamps can be either active or inactive.  When a stamp is inactive, it doesn't
show up on views that display active stamps, but it retains its data in case
the content item is re-stamped with that stamp type::

    >>> aStamp.isActive
    True
    >>> aStamp.isActive = False
    >>> aStamp.isActive
    False

Content items currently allow only one stamp of each kind.  This is not because
of any inherent issue, but because Chandler's stamping model is deliberately
crippled in this way.  If that design decision is ever revisited, it would be
straightforward to remove this restriction, but for now it's needed in order to
enforce the crippling at the API level::

    >>> item.actionStamps.add(Stamp())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: Only one 'Stamp' stamp allowed per content item

    >>> Stamp(contentItem=item)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: Only one 'Stamp' stamp allowed per content item


Stamping Operations
===================

``get_stamp(type)``
    Return the existing stamp (whether active or inactive) of type `type`.  If
    there's no existing stamp of the right type, returns ``None``::

        >>> print item.get_stamp(Stamp)
        Foo

        >>> class MyStamp(Stamp): pass
        >>> print item.get_stamp(MyStamp)
        None

``stamp(type)``
    Return an active stamp of the specified `type`.  If there's an existing
    stamp, this method returns it, after reactivating it if needed.  If there's
    no existing stamp of the right type, create one and return it::

        >>> aStamp.isActive
        False
        >>> stamp = item.stamp(Stamp)
        >>> stamp is aStamp
        True
        >>> aStamp.isActive
        True

        >>> stamp = item.stamp(MyStamp)
        >>> stamp.__class__
        <class 'MyStamp'>
        >>> stamp.isActive
        True

``unstamp(type)``
    Deactivate the existing active stamp of the specified `type`.  If there's
    no existing stamp of this type, the operation does nothing.

        >>> item.unstamp(MyStamp)
        >>> stamp.isActive
        False

        >>> class OtherStamp(Stamp): pass
        >>> item.unstamp(OtherStamp)


Contacts
========

A contact is a ``pim.content.Item`` that represents a person::

    >>> me = Contact(
    ...     firstName="Phillip", lastName="Eby", emailAddress="pje@example.com"
    ... )

and its display name is its email address::

    >>> me.displayName
    'pje@example.com'


----------------------
The Application object
----------------------

The ``pim.content.Application`` class represents the application as a whole.
Currently, its sole purpose is to serve as an anchor for application
configuration relationships, where one needs to find a special instance of some
type.  For example, the ``Contact`` that represents the user of the application
can be stored in an ``Application`` instance's ``user`` attribute::

    >>> from pim.content import Application
    >>> thisApp = Application(user = me)

To do something similar for a new type, you just need to create a relationship
between that type and ``Application``:

    >>> class Account(Item): """Dummy type for illustration purposes"""
    >>> acct = Account()

    >>> from spike import schema
    >>> class CurrentAccount(schema.Relationship):
    ...     app = schema.One(Application)
    ...     account = schema.One(Account)

    >>> CurrentAccount.account.of(thisApp)
    Set([], type=Account)

    >>> CurrentAccount.account.of(thisApp).add(acct)

    >>> CurrentAccount.account.of(thisApp)
    Set([<Account object at ...>], type=Account)
