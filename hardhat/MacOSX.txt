Notes about MacOSX build issues:

- Since we don't want to interfere with whatever Python is installed on the
  system already, we are building a private Framework version of Python.  This
  leads to some build problems since everyone seems to assume that the Python
  framework will be in /Library/Frameworks.  When building code that links 
  against the Python framework, the -F <path> flag needs to be passed to the 
  linker, telling it where to look for frameworks.  Distutils builds the 
  linking command lines based on information in the Python Makefile, so to
  get distutils to add the -F argument I modified the Python configure script
  to include -F in the LDSHARED variable.

  For details on the configuration of how we build Python, see the 
  http://svn.osafoundation.org/chandler/trunk/external/python/Makefile
