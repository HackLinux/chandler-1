Notes about MacOSX build issues:

- Building Python on the Mac results in two copies of Python executables, one
  under the Frameworks directory and one under the Applications directory.
  The python in Frameworks/ doesn't quite work when it comes to running a GUI
  application (mouse events seem to be ignored); however this python does 
  accept command line arguments (required for building egenix code, for 
  example).  The python in Applications/ does run GUI apps properly, however 
  it doesn't handle command line arguments, so egenix code doesn't build.
  Hardhat creates wrapper scripts around these two python executables in
  release/bin:
     python        (used for running Chandler)
     python.build  (used for building extensions)

- Since we don't want to interfere with whatever Python is installed on the
  system already, we are building a private Framework version of Python.  This
  leads to some build problems since everyone seems to assume that the Python
  framework will be in /Library/Frameworks.  When building code that links 
  against the Python framework, the -F <path> flag needs to be passed to the 
  linker, telling it where to look for frameworks.  Distutils builds the 
  linking command lines based on information in the Python Makefile, so to
  get distutils to add the -F argument I modified the Python configure script
  to include -F in the LDSHARED variable.
