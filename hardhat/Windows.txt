Notes about Windows build issues:

- OSAF is building everything using Visual Studio 7, and so the __hardhat__.py
  files use devenv.exe to build the various "solutions" we have set up.  If
  you don't have access to Visual Studio 7 we will be making frequent pre-built
  distributions of all the Chandler modules available on the website, so you
  don't need to build everything from scratch.
