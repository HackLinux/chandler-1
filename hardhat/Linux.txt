Notes about Linux build issues:

- I found that my RedHat 8.0 install didn't have the gtk+-devel RPM 
installed, and that includes a required file /usr/bin/gtk-config.  Make
sure you have that before building wxWindows.

- The pkg-config that comes with RH8 is too old according to the glib
that we're building, so I included a newer pkg-config as part of our
source tree.
