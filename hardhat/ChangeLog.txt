2003-07-01 Morgen Sagen

    * -D (create distribution) now takes a parameter which is a string that
        will be used as a build version (and this gets put into version.py,
        as well as incorporated into the distro filenames

    * tinderbox builds now work (tinderbuild.py)

    * singlebuild.py is a script which will build a Chandler from any date
        or CVS tag

    * tinderbuild.py and singlebuild.py are both clients of
        buildscripts/chandler.py which contains the instructions for
        how to do a complete Chandler build

    * Merged wxPython 2.4.1.2 into our codebase
