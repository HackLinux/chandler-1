# ChangeLog for HardHat

2003-07-01 Morgen Sagen

    * -D (create distribution) now takes a parameter which is a string that
        will be used as a build version (and this gets put into version.py,
        as well as incorporated into the distro filenames

    * tinderbox builds now work (tinderbuild.py)

    * singlebuild.py is a script which will build a Chandler from any date
        or CVS tag

    * tinderbuild.py and singlebuild.py are both clients of
        buildscripts/chandler.py which contains the instructions for
        how to do a complete Chandler build

    * Merged wxPython 2.4.1.2 into our codebase

    * Removed nightly.py which is superceded by singlebuild.py

    * HardHat can now be run from any directory as long as a parent directory
        contains a __hardhat__.py file (HardHat will now recursively check
        parent directories until a __hardhat__.py file is found).  This makes
        it easier to run scripts, for example, to run the wxPython demo:

            cd osaf/chandler/wxpython/wxPython/demo
            hardhat.py demo.py

    * Added the -l <scripts> option which "lints" the scripts using PyChecker
