Upgrading db build
------------------

 On Windows:
   - upgrade the vc++ project files to 7.1
   - change the Berkeley_DB.sln project to *NOT* build the static versions
     of the libraries, for two reasons:
       1. we don't need them and speeding up the build is welcome
       2. we want to *NOT* have them so when during a python upgrade, python
          attempts to link against the static libraries, we get an error
          instead of silent success and really hard to debug bugs later
   - copy these project files into persistence/db/win32 
   - make

 On other OS:
   - make


After upgrading Berkeley DB the systems that depend on it need to be
rebuilt, and re-released with an incremented RELVER number:
   - external/python
   - external/PyLucene (its Makefile needs DB_VER to be updated too)
