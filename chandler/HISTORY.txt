    * Details to be provided soon

Milestone 0.3.17 (CVS tag CHANDLER_0_3_17) 2004-06-01
    * Added Principal kind and type
    * Added ACL and ACE types
    * Added URL type to data model and core schema
    * Remote access over Jabber is working again
    * Implemented ACL store
    * Added ACL access APIs to Item, with epydoc
    * PyLucene Makefile.dev conditionally compiles with or without DbDirectory
    * PyLucene conditionally compiles DbDirectory on Linux, Windows and OS X
    * Added IndexReader, Term, TermEnum, TermDocs and TermPositions to PyLucene
    * Added patch for delete methods on IndexReader
    * Fixed bug where html pages weren't being found when run from Wing.
    * Updated TabbedContainers to use SynchronizeWidget.
    * Fixed the splash screen to not be system modal on Windows.
    * Disabled Close Tab menu item when only one tab is visible.
    * Fixed bug with tabs being unregistered in the background.
    * Added drag and drop framework. 
    * Addition of swig to our build environment
    * Added defaults to block XML.
    * Large amounts of refactoring of blocks to simplify, eliminate deadwood,
      generalize.
    * Added SummaryBlock 

Milestone 0.3.16 (CVS tag CHANDLER_0_3_16) 2004-05-18
    * Upgraded to wxWidgets 2.5.
    * Adoption of new build structure, isolating external/internal library 
      dependencies from pure Python code.
    * Unified Tree TreeList and List blocks to be almost completely data 
      driven.
    * Tree, ListTree and List now use a small delegate to abstract the display
      of their contents. The default List delegate uses a query to specify the
      list of items to display.
    * Queries now know when items change so they can notify blocks when to
      redisplay.
    * First implementation of the summary block.
    * We're beginning to refactor blocks to more clearly separate the model
      (block) from the view (widget). When you change the model (block), you
      can now call SynchronizeWidget on the block to cause the changes to be
      reflected in the widget. SplitWindow now implements SynchronizeWidget.
      We use this to show or hide panes of a splitWindow.

    * Added 'check repository' menu item to Chandler 'test' menu.
    * Added repository cache pruning.
    * Added Cloud support.
    * Remote access is revived, items are transfered over as clouds.

Milestone 13 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_13) 2004-1-21

    Content Model:

    * Fixed a problem with the python objects that would cause threading
      problems

    * Added Task attributes to CalendarEvent, and removed the Task kind

    * Tightened the types of attributes, taking advantage of circular
      references

    * Added descriptions, other comments to attributes and kinds

    * Generally added to the content model to better reflect design
      team's current thinking


    CPIA:

    * Created most basic blocks.

    * Created a demo parcel to show off the available building blocks as well
      as serve as a future unit test.

    * Split the block hierarchy into parcels.  Moved from having all of the
      ui specified in a single file to containing each parcel's description
      separate.

    * Began implementing the caterpillar ui.

    * Completed coding and testing of Chandler event dispatch using the
      notification manager. Events can be dispatched to the block that has 
      focus and bubbled up, broadcast to all blocks inside the event boundary, 
      and sent to a particular block.

    * Added, or rewrote, blocks that can be used to implement the repository
      viewer, which include: SplitWindow, TreeList, RepositoryTreeList and
      ItemView.

    * Added neccessary events for repository viewer, which include
      GetTreeListData, SelectionChanged and GoToURI.

    * Fixed lots of bugs in the menu blocks code

    Parcel Loader:

    * Parent parcels are loaded automatically

    * Circular references between parcels are now allowed

    * LoadParcel( ) allows you to load a single parcel (along with any
      dependencies)

    * PrintItem( ) recursively prints repository items to stdout

    * Added unit tests for: ensuring proper creation of Parcels, Kinds
      (and sub-Kinds), and attributes; checking dependency-loading;
      verifying circular references; assigning to inherited
      attributes; loading all parcels


    Repository:

    * Lucene full-text indexing integrated

    * "lob" (large object) support

    * Integrated libxml2 and updated db/dbxml/xerces libraries

    * Unit tests

    * Bug fixes


    HardHat:

    * You can now run a subset of the unit tests (all tests found
      in the current directory and below are run via hardhat.py -t)

    * HardHat and Tinderbox now distinguish between failed
      builds and failed unit tests


Milestone 9 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_09) 2003-11-11

    * Hardhat -g runs all files named parcel.xml through two xsl transforms
      in the distrib/transforms directory, and places the output in the
      debug/ or release/docs directory.

    * Added on demand loading of items within the RepositoryViewer.  The
      items viewed in the RepositoryViewer are not loaded until their
      parent is expanded.

    * Moved RepositoryViewer off of zodb.

Milestone 7 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_07) 2003-09-09

    Debugging:

    * Chandler's customized Python interpreter is debuggable with WingIDE
      if you install our debug modules from
      http://downloads.osafoundation.org/wing/

    * The PyCrust interactive shell is now included; to bring it up, enable
      the debug menu via Shift-Control-Alt-D and select Show Debugger Window.

    Launchers:

    * Fixed a bug where linux launcher would segfault if no LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    * Windows launcher overrides PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH variables to
      ensure we are picking up the intended Python extensions.

    * Python no longer checks the Windows registry for module paths so that 
      we don't accidentally pick up the wrong version of wxWindows, for
      example.

    Agent Framework:

    * First big check-in of agent framework

    * Added model directory with Chandler schema for Agent persistent data, 
      agents.xml

    * Added model classes AgentItem, Action, Condition, Instruction, Repertoire

    * Added Agent and AgentManager classes

    * Restructured the main loop to dispatch instructions faster, by 
      maintaining a hash table that associates instructions with notifications,
      so it only has to dispatch to the relevant instructions

    * Made instructions only have one condition, instead of a list of conditions

    * Made _postNotification call wxWakeUpIdle so we can use idle events to 
      poll for notifications, whilw still allowing the main loop to sleep 
      most of the time

    * Added an IsRegistered call to avoid registering twice

    * Made Conditions no longer inherit from Action, we will do polled 
      conditions some other way

    * Added text filtering to conditions, so they can select a data attribute
      from the notification and only trigger if it matches a string in the
      condition.  Three comparison modes are provides: equals, contains, and 
      matches, where matches treats the string in the condtion as a regular 
      expression.

    * Implemented the Repertoire class, so agents can reference conditions and 
      actions that aren't currently used in instructions

    * Added a repertoire with an action to the test agent

    * Added ability to load subclasses of Agents and Actions, by adding a 
      "class" attribute to their domain schema definition

    * Added a DeferredAction class, and the ability to run actions synchronously
      with wxWindows, by adding an app.defereredActions list, and invoking
      deferred actions in the ViewerParcel idle handler

    * Implemented a DialogAction subclass, that displays a dialog with a message
      derived from a  template string and the data passed from an action

    * Used DialogAction to make the test agent display a dialog with the
      instant message body if it meets the condition

    * Added a 'confirmFlag' to actions; if set, it asks the user's permission 
      via a dialog before executing the action.

    * Added an action permission request string, to specify the text for the
      permission request

    * Made deferredActions check the confirmFlag and put up a permissions
      dialog, if necessary

    * Added GetHandledStatus and SetHandledStatus methods in the notification
      manager to provide a simple mechanism for the system and other actions 
      to know when a notificaiton has been handled.

    * Added a listequals comparison mode that compares a list of 
      attribute/value pairs, and requires them all to be true for the 
      condition to fire

    * Used contact changed notifications and listequals comparison to add an 
      instruction to the test agent that puts up a dialog if the occupation is 
      set to 'Dentist'

    * Made sure the test agent works when it has more than one instruction

    * Added a 'presence approval agent' that can automatically approve presence
      subscription requests based on a pattern matching the requestor's jabber 
      ID.

    * Made the Jabber subsystem emit a notification for a presence subscription
      request, and made it check the 'handled' boolean after a delay to see if
      anyone handled it; if not, it puts up the dialog like it used to

    * Initialized the agent manager toward the end of the initialization
      process; it was being initialized before the notification manager.

    * Passed the actual notification object to actions instead of just the data

    Calendar:

    * Added participant to calendar model

    * Changed table view to use wxListCtrl instead of wxGrid

    * Added Generate Events feature (menu item, unit test)

    * Added displayAttribute to calendar kinds

    * Added code to list elements in a list or set in the html detail view

    ZaoBao:

    * Support for new data model and data framework

    * Added new feature: RSS auto discovery. Thanks to Mark Pilgrim's 
      rssfinder.py code and Stuart Lange for informing me about auto discovery

    Misc:

    * Added XSLT transformation of schema files via the "-g" flag

    * The zlib extension is now included on all three platforms.

Milestone 6 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_06) 2003-08-26

    * XML repository is included; to enable it, pass the -xml command line
      argument when running Chandler.

    * New Windows launcher program written in C

    * Linux and Windows launcher programs handle command line arguments;
      Haven't figured out how to pass arguments to an OSX .app, so you
      have to modify the RunChandler script directly to pass arguments.

    * Calendar:  Changed repository path/location of calendar schema to
      match proposal.

    * Contacts:  Ported contacts package to Andi's new repository.  Lots of
      changes, and probably lots of breakage, but it's working well enough
      for the initial check-in.

    * Created new RepositoryViewer parcel, to use the new repository.  This
      parcel may be short lived, or only used for debugging purposes.

    * The DBXML python extension statically links in libdb_cxx, libdbxml,
      and pathan libraries directly.

    * 4Suite added to site-packages.

    * PyXML added to site-packages.

Milestone 5 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_05) 2003-08-12

    * CHANDLERDIR environment variable is set when executing external commands

    * Parcels directory is put in sys.path when running unit tests

    * Made the notification manager be persisent.  This means registrations,
      subscriptions and declarations persist between program launches, but the
      actual queued notifications do not.

    * Added Location to calendar model

    * Changed names of calendar model attributes

    * Basic unit test for calendar data parcel, works with framework

    * Berkeley DB, DBXML, Pathan, and Xerces-c added to build

    * Python2.3 integrated

      directory

    * Fixed SplashScreen to be able to handle longer html pages that require
      scrolling.
 
    * Repository is loaded on init, globally accessible via app.repository.

    * Repository is saved when main Chandler window closes.

    * Calendar data parcel is loaded on init (currently hardcoded)

    * Created calendar data parcel as sub parcel of calendar parcel

    * Moved calendar viewer parcel code on to new repository
 
    * Fix for Bug#456 ("About Calendar" info page missing)

    * Removed discussion of a now-dead bug from the About page.
 
    * Re-entered fix for Bug#425

    * Mostly fixed Bug#421 on the mac: ends up drawn correctly on resize.
 
    * Added "About Contacts" Help menu option
 
    * Changed Repository parcel to use wxTreeListCtrl
 
    * ZaoBao: Internationalized strings with gettext()

    * tinderbuild.py now keeps the last 3 builds around so that
      people can get the latest bits

Milestone 3 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_03) 2003-07-15

    * Added the ability for parcels to add their version of the ActionsBar
      to ChandlerWindow.

    * Changed Repository parcel to use wxTreeListCtrl

    * Improperly formatted remote url's no longer cause an exeption within
      Chandler.  Parcels with xrc that doesn't have <label> as the first
      item in their menus will no longer cause an exception within
      Chandler.2003-04-13

    * Fixes for Bug#789 (call Destroy or use wxMessageBox for dialogs)

    * Re-entered fix for Bug#425

    * Mostly fixed Bug#421 on the mac: ends up drawn correctly on resize.

    * OSAF parcels were moved from parcels directory to parcels/OSAF.

    * HardHat changes:
        * nightly.py has been superceded by singlebuild.py (which is used
          for making releases
        * tinderbuild.py now keeps the last 3 builds around so that people
          can get the latest bits
        * hardhat.py can now be run from any directory as long as a parent
          directory contains a __hardhat__.py file (HardHat will now
          recursively check parent directories until a __hardhat__.py file
          is found).  This makes it easier to run scripts, for example, to
          run the wxPython demo:
            cd osaf/chandler/wxpython/wxPython/demo; hardhat.py demo.py
        * Added the -l <scripts> option which "lints" the scripts using
          PyChecker

Milesone 2 (CVS tag CHANDLER_M_02) 2003-07-01

    * Added the current version number to the status bar.

    * Hooked up the View menu items to show/hide the SideBar, NavigationBar,
      ActionsBar, and StatusBar.

   * Added very simple TableViewer (using wxGrid).

   * Refactored out observer-observable-notify pattern. Use view hierarchy for
     sizing, created a new wxCommandEvent for date changes. Fixed sizing bug
     in the process, Bug#421.

    * Made it so that entering addresses in the uriBox is no longer
      case sensitive.

    * Added a InstalledParcelsViewer parcel to handle the root url.

    * Added event resize. Clicking on the bottom region of an event will allow
      resize. We still need to fiddle with in-place editing to get this right,
      but allows resize for now. Bug#378
 
    * Also fixed a bug in the code for adding a remote item to the calendar --
      just a trivial copy-paste typo.

    * Migrated to the new data model, found in application.repository

    * Bug#416 In ColumnarView, made the header smaller and the footer of size 0.
      Given that we are not using these areas, make them small until we can
      use them effectively. Also removed the sunken borders for month and
      columnar viewers.

    * Bug#418 Selection is indicated with a black border, not by color.
      Clearly not the final answer, at least make selection vs. overlay clear.

    * Bug#414 Snap to grid for events in columnar view. When creating or 
      moving an event in place in the ColumnarView, start and end times stick
      to a half hour boundary. Also added a line boundary for the half hour.

    * added a template editor to allow the user to change the
      attributes and contact methods associated with a template
      
    * added a "new template and "delete template" command to
      the template editor, which enables the creation and
      destruction of templates
      
    * added support for enumerated types with multiple values,
      using a pop-up menu with checkbox items
      
    * removed the phone number formatting, since it wasn't

      pursue that yet
      
    * allowed deleting multiple contacts at once using multiple
      selection
      
    * added a disclosure triange to the control bar title, and
      made opening it display the current query, which is
      hard-wired for now.
      
    * made it display multiple contacts in the content view using
      folder tabs when you select multiple items in the list view
      
    * added an optional comment field to contact methods, and 
      a menu item to add or edit comments
      
    * converted to use the RDF model stuff plus lots of major
      restructuring to support that
      
    * added a free-form note item
    
    * fixed lots of bugs from the RDF conversion
    
    * got rid of the contact dictionary (internal structure) to
      pave the way for adding query infrastructure
      
    * added "Company" template that sorts differently
    
    * made companies show up in autocomplete of company field

    * made the "goto website" command actually work"

      Get/SetPreference Value
    * added preferencesMetaData.xml file to define types and labels for 
      preferences
    * added modular preference dialog, with section selector list on left and 
      fields on right
    * added Identity section to capture identity and jabber id of user
    * added Debug section with Debug menu checkbox just to have a second section
    * added architecture for parcels to add preferences, but not fully 
      implemented yet
    * polished Identity entry usability, so you can fill everything out without 
      needing to click
    * made it automatically log in to the jabber server after filling out 
      preferences
    
    Remote Browsing:
    
    * rewrote core Jabber routines that were written for vista using Chandler 
      conventions
    * added ChandlerWindow:ParseURL to url dispatching and passed a remote 
      address to GoToUri

      sidebar
    * gave parcels ability to redirect URLs addressed to them to other parcels
    * used that to implement remote browsing by clicking on views in the sidebar
    * added persistent message transcripts to roster package

        <python class of thing>   :    <thing uri>
           <attribute uri>        :    <attribute value>
     If <attribute value> is a thing, will recursively add a subtree.
     If <attribute value> is a dict or a list, will add subtree.

   Timeclock parcel:

       * Known problems: 
          * not using ZODB/persistence yet
          * can't add/remove customers dynamically
          * can't change rate dynamically
          * don't see time elapsing

       * Made hierarchical menu for currencies

       * Added an "About Timeclock" page.
       * Added the ability to change billing rates dynamically.
       * The current customer's billing rate is now visible. 
       * Stripped out a lot of unused (okay, unimplemented) stuff, e.g. 
         AddCustomer

       * Jed showed me how to persist the customer list in TimeclockView
       * Redid some comments
       * Moved "About Timeclock..." page to the Help menu, just to show how
       * Added two somewhat gratuitous menu items to the parcel menu so that
         there would be more than just the multi-level currency menu

       * Use customers from the Contacts list
       * Make start time not reset when leaving and re-entering the parcel

       * the second level of a multi-level menu doesn't pop up at all
       * wxTextCtrl boxes only show the last digit the first time
         they are shown.

       * Removed spurious import of Application's "app"
       * Changed clock start time to live properly in the model instead of
         the View.

       * Known problems:
          * Not using ZODB/RDF persistence yet
          * Background threads are not working well
          * Using '*' instead of unicode bullets for unread RSS feeds
          * Suffers from Bug#240 just as Contacts does
          * Not updating status bar
          * Right-click menu not working
          * Reload button not working
          * RSS feeds do not update in background
       * Made RSSData a subclass of InformationItem
       * RSS feed now uses ZODB for persistence
       * Still need more work to make it a real RDF object
       * Bug#240 seems to be fixed
       * Changed my implementation of Observable to Observable1 to reduce 
         confusion with Application.model's Observable
       * Decoupled observers from RSSData at parcel Deactivation
       * Remembers RSS feed selection at deactivation and selects last feed 
         at activation
       * Fixed Bug#383
       * Added comments
       * Refactored code so that list of RSS feeds are no longer a module 
         variable of RSSData.  This allows sharing of views, whereby each 
         view has its own list of RSS feeds
       * Support Andy's Viewer Parcel sharing framework
