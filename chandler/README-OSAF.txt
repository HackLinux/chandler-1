Here are some brief instructions for running Chandler on Windows:

I'd suggest download and installing WingIDE (http://www.WingIDE.com). You can try it out for 30 days free. Free licenses are also available for open source projects. Let me know if you want a license and I'll get one or you. You should also check out the WingIDE project and copy the new debugger I built with the version 7 Microsoft compiler: "WingIDE\bin\2.2.1\src\debug\server\dbgtracer22.pyd" and "WingIDE\bin\2.2.1\src\debug\server\dbgtracer22_d.pyd" over the top of the files with the same name in the WingIDE installation directories.

If you have trouble learning WingIDE, give me a call and I'll guide you through the initial steps.

E-mail me any problems you encounter so I can fix them.
