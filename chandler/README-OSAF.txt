Here are some brief instructions for running Chandler on Windows:

I'd suggest download and installing WingIDE (http://www.WingIDE.com). Check out the README-OSAF.txt in the wingIDE project.

If you have trouble learning WingIDE, give me a call and I'll guide you through the initial steps.

E-mail me any problems you encounter so I can fix them.
