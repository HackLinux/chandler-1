   * Added an "About Timeclock" page.

   * Jed showed me how to persist the customer list in TimeclockView
   * Redid some comments
   * Moved "About Timeclock..." page to the Help menu, just to show how
   * Added two somewhat gratuitous menu items to the parcel menu so that
     there would be more than just the multi-level currency menu

   * More known opportunities:
      * Use customers from the Contacts list
      * Make start time not reset when leaving and re-entering the parcel

   * Known bugs specific to Mac OS X (due to problems in the widgits):
      * the second level of a multi-level menu doesn't pop up at all
      * wxTextCtrl boxes only show the last digit the first time
        they are shown.

2003-04-24 Kaitlin Duck Sherwood <ducky@osafoundation.org>
   * Removed spurious import of Application's "app"
   * Changed clock start time to live properly in the model instead of
        the View.
