<H1>About Repository</H1>

The repository parcel is a low-level view which browses content in
Chandler's database holding a repository of data used by Chandler parcels.
Inspection of this low-level detail can potentially inform developers,
but typical users might find little practical information in this view
of the repository.
<P>
This display of repository content exposes internal details of the
representation, including schema and physical location information.
Such alternative views of persistent content permits developers to
confirm expectations about what should appear in the repository.
Future versions of the parcel might expand browsing features.
<P>
<!-- The SplashScreen will actually dismiss if you click on *any* text, not
just the text below.  It's big, blue, and underlined to give people's 
eyes a big target to click on.  -->
