    * restructured the main loop to dispatch instructions faster, by maintaining a hash
      table that associates instructions with notifications, so it only has to
      dispatch to the relevant instructions
      
    * made instructions only have one condition, instead of a list of conditions

    * at Andrew Francis' urging, made Conditions no longer inherit from Action,
    we will do polled conditions some other way
    
    * added text filtering to conditions, so they can select a data attribute
    from the notification and only trigger if it matches a string in the
    condition.  Three comparison modes are provides: equals, contains, and matches,
    where matches treats the string in the condtion as a regular expression.

    * implemented the Repertoire class, so agents can reference conditions and actions
      that aren't currently used in instructions
      
    * added a repertoire with an action to the test agent

2003-09-04 Andy Hertzfeld <andy@differnet.com>

     * added ability to load subclasses of Agents and Actions, by adding a "class"
       attribute to their domain schema definition
       
     * added a DeferredAction class, and the ability to run actions synchronously
       with wxWindows, by adding an app.defereredActions list, and invoking
       deferred actions in the ViewerParcel idle handler
       
     * implemented a DialogAction subclass, that displays a dialog with a message 
       derived from a  template string and the data passed from an action
       
     * used DialogAction to make the test agent display a dialog with the
       instant message body if it meets the condition
       
 2003-09-04 Andy Hertzfeld <andy@differnet.com>

     * added a 'confirmFlag' to actions; if set, it asks the user's permission via
       a dialog before executing the action.
       
     *  added an action permission request string, to specify the text for the
        permission request
     
     *  made deferredActions check the confirmFlag and put up a permissions
        dialog, if necessary
