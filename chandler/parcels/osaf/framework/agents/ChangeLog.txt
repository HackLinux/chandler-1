    * restructured the main loop to dispatch instructions faster, by maintaining a hash
      table that associates instructions with notifications, so it only has to
      dispatch to the relevant instructions
      
    * made instructions only have one condition, instead of a list of conditions

    * at Andrew Francis' urging, made Conditions no longer inherit from Action,
    we will do polled conditions some other way
    
    * added text filtering to conditions, so they can select a data attribute
    from the notification and only trigger if it matches a string in the
    condition.  Three comparison modes are provides: equals, contains, and matches,
    where matches treats the string in the condtion as a regular expression.
