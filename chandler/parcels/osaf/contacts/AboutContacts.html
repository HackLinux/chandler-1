<H1> About Contacts </H1>
<P>
The Contacts parcel is one of the core, fundamental parcels of
Chandler.  Here is a very brief discussion of the Contacts parcel as
it exists in the current release.  Note, however, that the Contacts parcel
is under very active development and is likely to change rapidly and
significantly.

<P>

<H2>Main panes</H2>
The Contacts parcel has two main panes: the list of Contacts in the
upper pane and the Contact Detail in the lower pane.
<P>
You can switch between viewing the list of Contacts as a table or as a
set of small "minicards" by selecting the appropriate view from the
pull-down menu at the upper right.
<P>

<H2> Adding and removing Contacts</H2>
<P>
In order to exercise Chandler's Contacts parcel, you might want to
generate some test Contacts.  Select <tt>Contacts->Generate 25
Contacts</tt> to generate twenty-five random Contacts.
<P>
To add a single Contact, select <tt>Contacts-&gt;Add New Contact</tt>.
You will be prompted for a Contacts template to use.  Each Contact
template has its own set of suggested fields for you to fill in at first.
(You can add more fields later by adding a Contact Method, discussed below.)
<P>
To remove a contact, 
select <tt>Contacts-&gt;Delete Selected Contact</tt>.
<P>
<H2> Modifying a Contact</H2>
<P>
You can modify any visible contact method by clicking on the item.
For example, to change a phone number, click on the phone number.
<P>
You can also add ways of contacting the person by selecting
<tt>Contacts-&gt;Add Contact Method to Current Contact</tt>.  For
example, you might want to add a cell phone number to someone's
contact info.  Once you've selected what type of contact method to
add, click on that contact method in the Detail View.  
<P>
<H2>Views</H2>
<P>
In the sidebar, there is a boxed "+" (Linux and Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac)
next to Contacts.  Clicking on that
shows different Views.
You can also select a different View from the Contacts menu.
<P>
The Contacts parcel ships with three Views in it: All, Coworkers, and Companies.  
Not surprisingly, these will show you 
<UL>
<LI>all the Contacts, 
<LI>all the Contacts in the Coworkers Group, and 
<LI>all the Contacts in the Companies Group.  
</UL>
<P>
You can also define your own Views.  Select the menu item 
<tt>Contacts->Add a New View</tt> and fill in the appropriate 
boxes.  For example, you could make a View called "Family" 
which shows all the Contacts that are in the group named "Family".

<H2>Groups</H2>
<P>
The Views described above show different Groups of Contacts.
To change a Contact's group membership, click on the groups that they
are belong to (or <tt>None</tt>).  The groups are next to the 
label <B>Member of</B> in the Detail View.
<P>

<H2>Contact Templates</H2>
As mentioned above under <B>Adding and Removing Contacts</B>, there are
different templates for creating contacts.  You can modify these templates
so that different fields appear while you are creating a contact.  Simply
select the fields that you wish to add by putting a mark in the box next
to the field.  To remove a field, remove the mark.
<P>
For example, if lots of your friends have cellphones, you might want to add
<TT>Cellphone</TT> to your <TT>Friends</TT> Contact template.
To do so, first select the menu item <TT>Contacts->Edit Contact 
Templates...</TT>.  Next, put a mark in the box next to <TT>Cellphone</TT> 
in the <TT>Contact Methods</TT> column.
<P>
You can also create new contact templates.  Select <TT>Contacts->Edit 
Contact</TT>, then click on the <TT>Create New Template</TT> button.  Once
you type in the name of your new template and click OK, you can modify it
in exactly the same way as you would modify an existing template. 



<A NAME="sharing"></A>
<H2> Sharing</H2>
<P>
If you have configured Jabber, then you
can share your Contacts information with others.
<P>
To the left of the headline (e.g. <B>All Contacts 25 items</B>)
is a small triangle.  Clicking on the triangle exposes another
pull-down menu.  If you select <tt>public</tt> from that menu and
have sharing enabled, other Chandler users
will be able to view any Contacts that you have marked
<tt>public.</tt>  (Note that both the overall Contacts sharing policy
and the policy for an individual Contact must be <tt>public</tt> for
it to be shared.  Note also that we plan to have much richer access
control levels in the future.)
<P>
To view someone else's Contacts information, look for their name under
<tt>Roster</tt> in the sidebar.  Click on the little triangle next to
their name, and Contacts should appear.  (If it doesn't, then they
haven't made their Contacts information <tt>public</tt>.)
<P>
Note that if you try to change a Contact in someone else's public
Contacts, you will get a warning that you are not allowed to change
other people's Contacts.  You will then have the option of copying
that contact record into your own Contacts list.
<P>
<!-- The SplashScreen will actually dismiss if you click on *any* text, not
just the text below.  It's big, blue, and underlined to give people's 
eyes a big target to click on.  -->
