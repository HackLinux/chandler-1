# ChangeLog for Contacts Parcel

2003-08-19 andy@differnet.com

   * ported contacts package to Andi's new repository.  Lots of changes, and probably
     lots of breakage, but it's working well enough for the initial check-in

    This initial entry describes work since the .02 release:
    
    * added a template editor to allow the user to change the
      attributes and contact methods associated with a template
      
    * added a "new template and "delete template" command to
      the template editor, which enables the creation and
      destruction of templates
      
    * added support for enumerated types with multiple values,
      using a pop-up menu with checkbox items
      
    * removed the phone number formatting, since it wasn't
      international, and we don't have the infrastructure to
      pursue that yet
      
    * allowed deleting multiple contacts at once using multiple
      selection
      
    * added a disclosure triange to the control bar title, and
      made opening it display the current query, which is
      hard-wired for now.
      
    * made it display multiple contacts in the content view using
      folder tabs when you select multiple items in the list view
      
    * added an optional comment field to contact methods, and 
      a menu item to add or edit comments

    * was away from ChangeLog for 10 days to implement remote browsing, so this
      report is large and unwieldy enough to break into sections
 
    Preference Dialog and machinery:
    
    * augmented preference class to support general persistent preferences via Get/SetPreference Value
    * added preferencesMetaData.xml file to define types and labels for preferences
    * added modular preference dialog, with section selector list on left and fields on right

    * added Debug section with Debug menu checkbox just to have a second section
    * added architecture for parcels to add preferences, but not fully implemented yet
    * polished Identity entry usability, so you can fill everything out without needing to click
    * made it automatically log in to the jabber server after filling out preferences
    
    Remote Browing:
    
    * rewrote core Jabber routines that were written for vista using Chandler conventions
    * added ChandlerWindow:ParseURL to url dispatching and passed a remote address to GoToUri
    * added EncodePythonObject and DecodePythonObject using base64 to escape whitespace
    * added view discovery send and receive via Jabber respecting view permissions
    * added object transfer send and receive via Jabber respecting view and item permission
    * added object transfer error handling
    * added presence panel to show presence and remote views as an outline in a window
    * added "roster" parcel and made it maintain presence and remote view links in sidebar
    * used name of contact rather than JabberID whenever possible
    * made roster parcels support multiple views when you click on name in sidebar
    * gave parcels ability to redirect URLs addressed to them to other parcels
    * used that to implement remote browsing by clicking on views in the sidebar
    * added persistent message transcripts to roster package
    * gave roster parcel the ability to send and receive Jabber instant messages
    * easy way to copy remote objects to local if you try to edit them
    * made it discover views and update presence after logging in
    * made sidebar and presence panel automatically update as things change
    * made the "Compose IM" menu command when clicking on an IM address actually work, enabled when present
 
    Contacts features and bug fixing:
    
    * added contact view links to the sidebar
    * fixed bizarre Linux bug Ducky found where typing would be entered backwards
    * fixed Linux not getting the proper font in the name field and others
    * fix columns and titles auto-sizing in list view on Linux

   * Migrated the contacts parcel to the new data model, found in
     application.repository. 
      * application.model.LocalRepository => application.repository.Repository
      * application.model.ContactEntityItem => application.repository.Contact
      * application.model.ContactMethodItem => 
        application.repository.ContactMethod
      * application.model.Namespace => application.repository.Namespace
   * Modified attribute names to use namespaces: "sharing" => chandler.sharing
   * Modified ContactModel's attribute dictionary to use the new model.
   * In general, removed the "name/fullname" convention. Instead of 
     SetNamePart(), call SetNameAttribute().
