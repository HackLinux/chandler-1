# ChangeLog for Calendar Parcel

2003-07-24 Katie Capps Parlante <capps@osafoundation.org>
   * Created calendar data parcel as sub parcel of calendar parcel
   * Moved calendar viewer parcel code on to new repository

2003-07-15
   * Fix for Bug#456 ("About Calendar" info page missing)
   * Removed discussion of a now-dead bug from the About page.

2003-07-14 capps@osafoundation.org

   * Fixes for Bug#789 (call Destroy or use wxMessageBox for dialogs)
   * Re-entered fix for Bug#425
   * Mostly fixed Bug#421 on the mac: ends up drawn correctly on resize.

2003-07-10 john@osafoundation.org

   * Moved from parcels directory to parcels/OSAF.

2003-06-20 capps@osafoundation.org

   * Added very simple TableViewer (using wxGrid).

2003-06-17

   * Refactored out observer-observable-notify pattern. Use view hierarchy for
     sizing, created a new wxCommandEvent for date changes. Fixed sizing bug
     in the process, Bug#421.

2003-04-15

   * Added event resize. Clicking on the bottom region of an event will allow
     resize. We still need to fiddle with in-place editing to get this right,
     but allows resize for now. Bug#378

   * Also fixed a bug in the code for adding a remote item to the calendar --
     just a trivial copy-paste typo.

2003-04-13 

   * Migrated to the new data model, found in application.repository

2003-04-09 Katie Capps Parlante <capps@osafoundation.org>

   * Created this change log for the calendar parcel

   * Bug#416 In ColumnarView, made the header smaller and the footer of size 0.
     Given that we are not using these areas, make them small until we can
     use them effectively. Also removed the sunken borders for month and
     columnar viewers.

   * Bug#418 Selection is indicated with a black border, not by color.
     Clearly not the final answer, at least make selection vs. overlay clear.

   * Bug#414 Snap to grid for events in columnar view. When creating or 
     moving an event in place in the ColumnarView, start and end times stick
     to a half hour boundary. Also added a line boundary for the half hour.
