<H1>About Calendar</H1>
The calendar parcel is one of the core, fundamental parcels of Chandler.  

<H2>How to Add an Event</H2>
To add an event to the calendar, click on the location of the starting 
time/date.  Hold the mouse button down while you drag to the ending time
from the start time, then release the button.  
<!-- @@@ The arrow in the first picture is ugly!--->
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TD><IMG SRC="CreateEventStart.jpg"></TD>
<TD>Clicking and dragging your cursor from 11 AM to 2 PM (as shown at left) gives you an event starting at 11 AM and ending at 2 PM (as shown at right).</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="CreateEventEnd.jpg"</TD>
</TABLE>
<P>

(Currently, there can
be a several second delay the first time you create an event.  We are
working on fixing that bug.)


<A NAME="#description"></A>
<H2>How to Add a Description</H2>

To add a description to an event: 
<UL>
<LI>click in the center of the event to select the event,
<LI>click again to enter description mode, then
<LI>type the description.  
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="#move"></A>
<H2>How to Move and Copy an Event</H2>

You can also move and copy events to a new time and date.  
<A NAME="#windowsMove"></A>
<H3>Moving Events under Windows</H3>
In Chandler for Windows, 
drag and drop the event to move it and Control-drag to copy it. 
<P>
<A NAME="#macOsMove"></A>
<H3>Moving Events under Mac OS X</H3>
On the Mac, currently you can drag and drop to copy, but there
is a known bug that there isn't a way to move an event.  We plan
on changing this to a simple drag and drop for moves; we haven't
decided what we will do (if anything) for copies.
<P>
<A NAME="#linuxMove"></A>
<H3>Moving Events under Linux</H3>
In Chandler for Linux, drag and drop the event to copy it and shift-drag 
it to move it.  (This is behavior that we inherited from our UI toolkit;
we're currently evaluating whether or not to change this behavior.)
<P>

<H2>How to Change the Time</H2>
To change the ending time of an event,
drag the bottom of the event to the new end time.
<P>
To change the starting time, move the event to its new starting time (as 
discussed above).
<P>
<H2>Future Work</H2>
The calendar is still under very active development.  
More features are coming soon!

<!-- The SplashScreen will actually dismiss if you click on *any* text, not
just the text below.  It's big, blue, and underlined to give people's 
eyes a big target to click on.  -->
