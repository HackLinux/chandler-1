<H1>About Calendar</H1>
The calendar parcel is one of the core, fundamental parcels of Chandler.  
<P>
To add an event to the calendar, simply drag from the start time
to the end time.  To add a description to an event, first click in the center
of the event, then type the description.  To change the duration of an 
event, drag the bottom of the event to the new end time.
<P>
You can also move and copy events to a new location.  In Chandler for Windows, 
drag and drop the event to move it and Control-drag to copy it. 
<P>
On the Mac, currently you can drag and drop to copy, but there
is a known bug that there isn't a way to move an event.  We plan
on changing this to a simple drag and drop for moves; we haven't
decided what we will do (if anything) for copies.
<P>
In Chandler for Linux, drag and drop the event to copy it and shift-drag 
it to move it.  (This is behavior that we inherited from our UI toolkit;
we're currently evaluating whether or not to change this behavior.)
<P>
There is also a known bug that on event copies, the
new event is not stored persistently.  If you copy an event, switch
to Contacts, then switch back to Calendar, you will only see the original 
event.
<P>
The calendar is still under very active development.  
More features are coming soon!

eyes a big target to click on.  -->
