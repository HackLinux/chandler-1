<H1>About Repository Viewer</H1>
The Repository Viewer parcel is designed to help developers debug their
data schema and Repository code.  This parcel probably won't be very 
interesting to end-users.
<P>
Users can expand and collapse elements in the <B>Containment Path</B> column
to see more or fewer levels of hierarchy.  
<P>
<B>Display Name</B> is for human-readable names. Display names can be 
set with the &lt;displayName&gt; tag in the XML source or the displayName
attribute in Python.
If the display name wasn't set, the Universally Unique IDentifier 
(see below) is used.
<P>
<B>Kind</B> tells what schema the Item has.
<P>
<B>UUID</B> is the Universally Unique IDentifier.  This ID should be 
unique across all Chandler repositories.  
<P>
<B>URL</B> is the Uniform Resource Locator -- an address where this item
can be found.
