  All parcels must define parcelClass in their __init__.py to tell the
parcel loader which class defines the parcel. parcelClass is a string
with two parts separated by a period. The first part specifies the file
containing the class (e.g. CalendarView.py) and the second string
specifies the class of the parcel (e.g. CalendarView)
