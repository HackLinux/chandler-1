<H1>About MrMenus</H1>

MrMenus is a sample parcel that shows programmers how your parcel's own 
menus and menu items can be incorporated into Chandler's menu structure. 
It consists of a very simple user interface that includes a parcel menu, 
and custom menu items inserted in Chandler menus. MrMenus is only a 
demonstration for programmers designed
to go along with a <A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/MrMenusTutorial">MrMenus</A> tutorial -- it doesn't provide any actual 
functionality for users.
