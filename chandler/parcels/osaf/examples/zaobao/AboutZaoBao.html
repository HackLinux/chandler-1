<H1>About ZaoBao</H1>
ZaoBao (which is Mandarin for "morning newspaper") is an example 
parcel which aggregates
<A HREF="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS</A>-syndicated documents.
RSS is most commonly used for weblogs or "blogs".
<P>
For the 0.3 release, ZaoBao has seven Views that correspond to seven different
weblogs.  Clicking on the open/close symbol next to ZaoBao in the sidebar will show the
seven different Views, which you can then click on to see articles in the
corresponding weblog.  (The open/close symbol is a box with a "+" in it on Unix and Windows,
and a triangle on the Mac.)
<P>
Once you click on one of the blog Views, the main content window will split 
into an index View at the top and a detail View at the bottom.  The index View
shows different articles' title and date posted.  Clicking on an article in the
upper index View will bring up that article in the detail View.
<P>
Note that in ZaoBao, as in most RSS-aggregators, only the first little bit
of an article is shown.  To see more of an article, click on the headline 
(in blue) and the full article will be sent to your default Web browser.
