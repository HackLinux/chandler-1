# ChangeLog for ZaoBao Parcel

2003-03-25 Chao Lam <chao@osafoundation.org>

   * Initial conversion of stand-alone ZaoBao to ZaoBao parcel
   * Known problems:
      * Not using ZODB/RDF persistence yet
      * Background threads are not working well
      * Using '*' instead of unicode bullets for unread RSS feeds
      * Suffers from Bug#240 just as Contacts does
      * Not updating status bar
      * Right-click menu not working
      * Reload button not working
      * RSS feeds do not update in background

2003-04-01 Chao Lam <chao@osafoundation.org>
   * Made RSSData a subclass of InformationItem
   * RSS feed now uses ZODB for persistence
   * Still need more work to make it a real RDF object
   * Bug#240 seems to be fixed
   * Changed my implementation of Observable to Observable1 to reduce confusion with Application.model's Observable

2003-04-07 Chao Lam <chao@osafoundation.org>
   * Decoupled observers from RSSData at parcel Deactivation
   * Remembers RSS feed selection at deactivation and selects last feed at activation
   * Fixed Bug#383
   * Added comments

   * Refactored code so that list of RSS feeds are no longer a module variable of RSSData.
This allows sharing of views, whereby each view has its own list of RSS feeds
   * Support Andy's Viewer Parcel sharing framework

   * Internationalized strings with gettext()
