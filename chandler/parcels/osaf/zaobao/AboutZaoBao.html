<H1>About ZaoBao</H1>
ZaoBao is an news aggregator which takes advantage of 
<A HREF="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS</A>-syndicated documents.  
("ZaoBao" is Mandarin Chinese for "morning newspaper".) RSS is particularly
popular for Web logs ("blogs").
<P>
Click the "Reload" button on the Chandler toolbar to poll for new data in your subscribed channels
(background polling is not supported by Chandler yet). You can remove a feed by selecting the <tt>Delete Item</tt> from the ZaoBao menu.
You can add a feed by entering its URL in the text entry box to the left of the "Add" button.
<P>
You can find URLs for many RSS feeds at sites like
<A HREF="http://www.syndic8.com/">Syndic8</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.daypop.com/">DayPOP</A>, and
<A HREF="http://subhonker6.userland.com/rcsPublic/rssHotlist">Userland</A>.
If you see a tiny graphic with "XML" in white on an orange background, that should
take you to an RSS URL, which you can then insert into the Add box.
<P>
Perhaps ZaoBao's most interesting feature is that it was 
developed by Chao Lam, OSAF's Product Manager, on his nights
and weekends.  Chao was not familiar with 
RSS, python, wxWindows, wxPython, or Chandler source when 
he started this project.
<P>
Chao used Mark Pilgrim's fine
<A HREF="http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/rssparser.py.txt">Ultra-liberal
Feed Parser</A> and <A HREF="http://diveintomark.org/projects/rss_finder/">RSS Finder </A>
(for RSS auto discovery) as a base, and someone less modest than he wrote this text,
but Chao got minimal support otherwise.  While ZaoBao started as a hobby project,
it turned into a compelling proof that users would be able to develop 
Chandler parcels easily.
