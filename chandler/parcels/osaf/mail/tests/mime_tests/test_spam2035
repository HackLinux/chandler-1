Subject: Re: NSC: I was in a car crash :0(

Freaky. I was in a similar accident that also happened on Tuesday. I 
stopped at a red light (the last light before my house and only a minute 
away), but the lady behind me didn't stop in time and bumped into me. 
Fortunately she was braking and going very slow so there was no damage or 
injuries. She looked startled and distracted when I looked at her in my 
rear view mirror. We pulled over to the side to check for damage. At least, 
I did. She stayed in her car and apologized. When I got home I did end up 
finding a small scratch on my bumper. Eh.

Hope you feel better soon, Sarah.

Hey all, Just thought that I'd drop u all a line to tell you that
yesterday, Tuesday, I was in a car crash (accidental) with my sister
and a friend.  Everybody lived to tell the tale.  My sister and I are in
a crap load of pain from the whiplash.   The story:  We were on Huron
Line (street that connects Windsor,ON to Detroit, MI) with a green
light.  The car infront of me stopped due to heavy traffic.  I stopped. 
Girl behind us...not so much.  We heard screeching tires then felt the
big bang.   At least there were no life threatening injuries. Yours in
fumbling,Sarah the canuck (fumbling towards ice packs, tylenol and
motrin)

Subject: [OAC] Michelle Branch on Tonight Show... Cello Q?

Just caught Michelle on Wed's Tonight Show. She did a different take of 
"All You Wanted," with acoustic guitar, piano and cello. The performance 
was great, but what really caught my attention was the cello. It didn't 
have the large wooden front and back panels, and it had edges that looked 
like they were made of metal. It was as if it had the outline of a cello 
but without the body. What kind of cello was this?

Strange indeed since all of the spam I've been getting shows that it's
addressed to jenni@fumblers.org or undisclosed.recipients@fumblers.org or
webmaster@fumblers.org. *shrugs* I just know that once I got rid of my

I was listening to the radio this morning before going to class and Vanessa was on.  She admitted that she and John Mayer are going out.  How sweet!  What a cute couple! :)

P.S. So yeah I think Jess is right about Vanessa's CD.  I think the strongest songs are Ordinary Day and A Thousand Miles.  She's good but just not totally there yet.

        On the topic of pets...

        Yesterday, on my birthday no less, my youngest rabbit died.  Lil'
Pun (named so because he and his big brother resembled the late hip hop
artist "Big Pun") was only about a year and a half old, far too young to
leave this world.  No apparent cause of death, though I suspect it was a
digestive problem.

        He leaves behind his mother, Shady, his brother, Big Pun, and his
uncle Ash (the notorious gray fumblebunny so many of you have seen on
T-boy's tape).  LP was an adorable brown lop-eared wascally wabbit, he'll
be dearly missed.


saddened,
A.J.

And I'll soon have pics to post of our newest addition to the family. We get
to pick Phoebe up next weekend or sometime next week. She'll be 6 weeks old
next weekend and she's the cutest little thing! Dan's brother's cat got
knocked up and had 4 of the most adorable kittens. Two of them have calico
markings and the other two are these cute little gray fluffy balls. Our
little Phoebe (yes we already have a name picked out) is gray with white
around her left eye, on the tip of her tail and on a couple of her paws. I
can't wait to bring her home. We're just praying that she's not as wacko as
our other cat was when we brought her home. But in doing some research, we
found that taking kittens too soon from their mothers can cause behavioral
problems. That must explain our cat Sophie! And anyone who knows Sophie,
knows what I'm talking about!

Ahhh! I love big old orange tom cats! Dan's mom has an old tom cat named
Killer and he's the biggest orange tiger you've ever seen. Of course his
name doesn't fit his disposition. He's a gentle little lamb, unless you're
Dan. Then Killer turns into a hissing machine! ;-) Anyhoo, cute cat Noor!

Subject: h*lp please :-)

I could use some h*lp if anyone wouldn't mind giving me a minute of their time...

I'm writing a paper for class, on our college meal plan and how to make it better.  So I was wondering, for any college students that live on campus, (or former students) if you could explain how the meal plan at your college works.  Whether its on a cash or meal basis, what you can get with it, and any other details.   Also, I would really like to know your opinion on it, whether or not you like it, and how it could be improved. 

Thanks in advance!

I'll bet I'm the only one here with a 17 year old one-eyed cat!  He's just
adorable, even if my friends have nicknamed him "Pet Cemetery".  Uncaring
bastards.  :)

His proper name is Tigger (given to him by my sister, who was about 8 at the
time).  Personally, I would have chosen the name "Doggie", or perhaps "Furry
Death Bunny".  I would send a picture, but I'm lazy right now.  Perhaps
later.

My school signed a thing with MS that allows us to take on copy of their

under 10 dollars.

I'm debating on whether to get Office 2000 pro or XP pro... which is better?

C'mon lazy boy! You can't post about a one-eyed almost gone cat and not post

I've used both.  I currently have 2000 at work and XP at home.
Honestly, there really isn't a huge difference between the two.  They
added some nice little hovers on buttons in XP (that's not really
functional but it looks sorta' nifty).  Some things in XP are a pain
(they totally changed the way you draw shapes, etc., in word).  They
also changed the clip art format.  I've always been a fan of Outlook and
I really like 2002 (the XP version) better than 2000.  If I were you,
I'd get XP since it's the latest.  Other than that, there really are no
other differences.  Ten bucks, what a deal!

        Any XP titles will be developed further and supported longer than
any older 2000 titles.  That's the real difference.

pay for billboard space in West Hollywood for one
month in a plea to bring back the series for at least
another season.

If you're in the L.A. area, it will be up for the next
month and since it is an illuminated billboard, it
will be visible at all hours. (A regular ole billboard
woulda cost half as much, but OandA fans don't do

Unlikely. I'm sure if I had the actual study to read I could poke lots
of fun little holes in it.
Every other study done in the last 50 years has found more male
nonheterosexuals than female nonheterosexuals. And MUCH more than 1 to
2.7 percent.
I'd also like to hear what this PATH Through Life Project is. Sounds
like some kind of Christian brainwashing farm.
And something tells me 4824 Austrialians don't look much like 4824
Americans.
