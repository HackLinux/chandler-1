AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Over the past six months thousands of people have earned between $300,000 - $1,000,000 CASH each, recession proof, Including a 15 year old boy who earned more than $71,000 in less than 5 weeks.

I am still truly amazed by the simplicity and speed of how this works. Ask yourself a question: Am I too busy to take a few minutes NOW to discover something that WILL CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER !?!

Read on... Your Family Deserves It...

"Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in closet."

September 5, 2001

Does this headline look familiar?

Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (ABC, CBS, 20-20, etc.). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off of the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.

The email letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk email all the time, and really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the email, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me.I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the email."The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet,barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.

..It was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.

Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by email, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the instructions in this letter.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION

"Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time"

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!

Before you say "bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money.

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say:

"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Here is another testimonial:

"This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following.....
THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR
FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.
For each report send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk.

****IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it.

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will NOT work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the rewards!!!

1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5.

This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2. Move the name & address in REPORT #4 down TO REPORT #5.

3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.

4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down TO REPORT #3.

5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2

6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you lose any data.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailings receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0,2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's = 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out.
The 0.20% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5.
THATS 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half million).

Your total income in this example is:
1 $50 +
2 $500 +
3 $5,000 +
4 $50,000 +
5 $500,000 Grand Total = $555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.

Dare to think for a-moment what would happen if everyone, or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting.

Believe me, many people will do just that and more!

METHOD #2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # I and add METHOD #2 as you go along.

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will, guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.

AVAILABLE REPORTS ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.

Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets pf paper write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
After you have received 10 orders: 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.

MORE TESTIMONIALS

My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses.

Within the next 45 days she had received a total of$ 147,200.00 all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her "hobby".

Mitchell Wolf M.D. Chicago, Illinois

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.

I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else. 11 months passed then it luckily came again I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks".

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y

"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, 560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to the internet".
