<h1>About the Roster Parcel</h1>

One of Chandler's key features is peer to peer sharing. We will eventually have many cool sharing features,
but the first one we've implemented is remote browsing of other user's data. The Roster parcel displays the presence state
of other users you wish to collaborate with and allows you to share data with them. It currently uses
<a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> as the underlying protocol for remote browsing,
so you will need a Jabber account somewhere in order to use the
sharing features. In the future, we will support other protocols as well as Jabber.
<p>
(Note: 
Jabber servers have a parameter called "karma" that restricts the amount of information that users 
can send in a given time interval.  They typically come with a low karma setting by default, 
since people can't really send instant messages very quickly.  We suggest you set the karma 
settings on your Jabber server higher if you can.)
</p><p>
Chandler will automatically register a new account if your Jabber server permits it; otherwise you must 
ask your server administrator to assign you a jabber ID.  To register a new ID, or login with an existing one, 
select <tt>Preferences</tt> from the Chandler <tt>Edit</tt> menu and fill in your <tt>Identity</tt> 
information.

The Roster parcel displays links in the sidebar for each user in your roster, in light grey if the
user isn't currently present. The sidebar also displays links to remote views from that person that are
currently accessible to you. If you click on a remote link, you can browse items from a remote
repository.

</p><p>
The Roster parcels enables you to send and receive instant messages from other Chandler users, or Jabber users in general, 
It will maintain a transcript of your conversations on a per-user basis. When you receive an instant message, the sender's
link turns green until you've read the message.  There are also menu commands that allow you to add or remove
people from the Roster.

Like all of Chandler, the Roster parcel is still in an early stage of it's development.  Stay tuned for more exciting
features coming soon...
