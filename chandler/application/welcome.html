<H1>Welcome to Chandler Release 0.1!</H1>

We at OSAF are delighted that you downloaded the 0.1 release of
Chandler!  We hope that this release of Chandler will give you a flavor
of Chandler's architecture and APIs, and a glimse of what Chandler will 
do in the future.
<P>
Please note that Chandler is still in its <I>extremely</I> early stages, with only
a very limited set of capabilities.  <B>Please</B> read the 
<A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerOhPointOneREADME">README</A> -- 
it has information on known bugs, our future plans, volunteering,
and where to go for futher documentation.
<P>
Please also understand that our underlying database is undergoing
massive changes at the moment.  What we're using now <I>will not be</I> 
what we use in the future.  This means that 
<FONT COLOR="red">you should not store important information in Chandler</FONT> yet.
