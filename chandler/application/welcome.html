<H1>Welcome to Chandler Release 0.2!</H1>
Welcome to the 0.2 release of Chandler!

The .2 release focuses on underlying infrastructure and is not useful for 
ordinary users.  There has been little if any work on the user interface 
since the previous release.

<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerRepository">Repository</A></B>: We have converted most of Chandler code to use our
own Item store.  See the Repository Viewer parcel for a window
onto the Repository.
Note that our underlying databases are still undergoing
changes, so
<FONT COLOR="red">you should not store important information in Chandler</FONT> yet.
<P>
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/DataModel">Data Model</A></B>: Chandler now incorporates a very flexible 
data model that allows a full spectrum of data representations, from loosely
structured to highly structured. 
<LI><B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/NotificationModel">Notification Manager</A></B>: The notification manager provides a publish and subscribe mechanism for various parts of Chandler to communicate high level events.
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/AgentFrameworkPoint2Status">Agent 
Framework</A></B>: The Agent Framework is partially implemented in the .2 release.  The underlying machinery for defining agents that automatically respond to conditions as they arise is present, but there's no user interface yet.  There are two test agents that don't do much yet.
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerPresentationAndInteractionArchitecture">Chandler Presentation and Interaction Architecture</A></B>: The 
rudimentary beginnings of a novel presentation and interaction framework 
are now in Chandler.  See the Document parcel for an example.

<P>
Please note that Chandler is still in its very early stages, with only
a very limited set of capabilities.  <B>Please</B> read the 
<A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerZeroPointTwoREADME">
README</A> -- 
it has information on known bugs, our future plans, volunteering,
and where to go for futher documentation.
