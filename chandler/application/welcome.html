<H1>Welcome to Chandler Release 0.2!</H1>
Welcome to the 0.2 release of Chandler!

This release incorporates many improvements to Chandler's fundamental 
architecture.

<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerRepository">Repository</A></B>: We have converted most of Chandler code to use our
own Item store.  See the Repository Viewer parcel for a window
onto the Repository.
Note that our underlying databases are still undergoing
changes, so
<FONT COLOR="red">you should not store important information in Chandler</FONT> yet.
<P>
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/DataModel">Data Model</A></B>: Chandler now incorporates a very flexible 
data model that allows a full spectrum of data representations, from loosely
structured to highly structured. 
<LI><B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/NotificationModel">Notification Manager</A></B>: The Notification Manager provides a richer 
framework for what are usually called "events."  (We use "Events" for "Calendar
Events", hence the different name.)
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/AgentFrameworkPoint2Status">Agent 
Framework</A></B>: The underlying framework for Agents is in place,
with three example agents.
<LI> <B><A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerPresentationAndInteractionArchitecture">Chandler Presentation and Interaction Architecture</A></B>: The 
rudimentary beginnings of a novel presentation and interaction framework 
are now in Chandler.  See the Document parcel for an example.

<P>
Please note that Chandler is still in its very early stages, with only
a very limited set of capabilities.  <B>Please</B> read the 
<A HREF="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/ChandlerZeroPointTwoREADME">
README</A> -- 
it has information on known bugs, our future plans, volunteering,
and where to go for futher documentation.
